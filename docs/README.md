> [!attention|iconVisibility:hidden|labelVisibility:hidden|style:callout] This project is a skeleton template that is used with the [LFTP4WIN](https://github.com/userdocs/LFTP4WIN) installer
> script and this repo is for the skeleton files only and not the installer.

You will need to have installed [LFTP4WIN](https://github.com/userdocs/LFTP4WIN) for this project to be applied and it does not work on it's own. The scripted installer download can be kept to a very small size this way and the skeleton files downloaded and applied as as part of that installation.

Once you have done that you can use this documentation to understand, configure and extend your installation.

I hope you enjoy the project.
